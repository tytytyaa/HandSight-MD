Handsight was inspired by the challenges that the general population has in understanding Sign Language (SIBI), which is used by deaf and speech-impaired people to communicate. The project's goal is to create an artificial translator capable of translating Sign Language using live moving object detection via a mobile phone camera. The project strategy entails translating Sign Language into Indonesian Language, while taking into account the peculiarities in expression in each. The project will be created as a mobile app. Users can use the application's capabilities. When an object displays Sign Language in front of the camera, translation begins. Following the demonstration of Sign Language, the application will translate and display the translation result. The project's goal is to assist members of the general public who are not fluent in Sign Language and to give a broader platform for deaf and speech-impaired people to express themselves and communicate more effectively with the general public.
